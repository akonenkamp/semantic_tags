<center><h3>Why?</h3></center>
<center>In the early 1990's my dad came across a woman who had driven her car in to a retention pond. He quickly reacted and saved the woman's life.  He made it on the news and was honored for his heroic efforts. The best part, he didn't even know what he was saying was hilarious!</center>
