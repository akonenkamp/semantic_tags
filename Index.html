<h1>My Dad the Red Blooded American</h1>
  <br>
<h3>Why?</h3>
In the early 1990's my dad came across a woman who had driven her car in to a retention pond. He quickly reacted and saved the woman's life.  He made it on the news and was honored for his heroic efforts. The best part, he didn't even know what he was saying was hilarious!

  Joe Konenkamp is a humble hardworking American from Macon, Georgia. He is the youngest of eight, because his mother saved the best for last. Joe is a proud father who enjoys all things involving ice cream and Budweiser! Lastly, if it's broken and you can't fix it, odds are, Joe can!

    <h3>What Joe Would Want You to Know About His Experience:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>He isn't a hero</li>
    <li>He did what any red blooded american would do</li>
    <li>If he hadn't been there, Keisha Benjamin would have died</li>
    <li>But he still <mark><u>is not</u></mark> a <b>hero</b></li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h3>What Happened to Keisha?</h3>
  No one knows! What we do know is that Keisha left the scene of the accident with my father's Member's Only jacket never to return it to its owner. A detail regaled by Joe to this day!
